### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Select Role

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Academic Path
The user navigates through four dependent dropdowns:
1. Faculty  
2. Degree  
3. Field  
4. Subspecialty

These are dynamically loaded from the JSON file:
`/config/academic_structure_full.json`

Each dropdown is enabled only after the previous one is selected.
